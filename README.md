# Handling User Authentication

## Project Description

Set up a standalone project to do unit testing of the user authentication class which is used in the main web application. The objective is to create a JUnit class that will test all aspects of the authentication class.

As a part of developing an ecommerce web application, a test-suite is being created to do unit testing of all backend components in the web application. This project will test the user authentication class. This project will be a standalone Java application, since Junit does not directly test servlets or web pages. We are only testing the classes that have the business logic.

## Technologies Used

- Eclipse as the IDE
- Apache Tomcat as the web server
- Junit 5

## Requirements

- Create a standalone Java application using Maven
- Create an authentication class that has all the methods related to user authentication
- Create a JUnit test class to create unit tests for the authentication class
- Run the test class directly as a JUnit and check if all the tests pass
- Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task
